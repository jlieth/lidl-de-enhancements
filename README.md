### Filter online/offline articles

The article view always shows online and offline articles together (usually with
a lot more online-only articles). This is annoying if you just want to know
what your local store has on offer this week.

With this extension you can filter the article list for online and offline
articles.

### Ads/Teasers

There are often ads/teasers for related articles and offers in
the article listing. I think they're annoying so I decided to hide them.
